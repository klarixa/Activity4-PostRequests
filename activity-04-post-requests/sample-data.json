Here's what worked: 2 cups flour, 1 cup brown butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 2 eggs, 2 cups chocolate chips. Bake at 350°F for exactly 12 minutes. The cookies come out crispy on the edges but soft in the middle - absolute perfection!",

Visited the ancient Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa - the incense and traditional architecture were breathtaking. Tried authentic tonkotsu ramen in Shibuya (best meal ever!), and watched the sunrise from Tokyo Skytree at 634 meters high. The cherry blossoms were in full bloom around the Imperial Palace - absolutely magical. Already planning my next trip back to explore Kyoto!",

    "Use the Network tab in DevTools to see actual HTTP requests",

    "Practice error handling by submitting empty forms",
